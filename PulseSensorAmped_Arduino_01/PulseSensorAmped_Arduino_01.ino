>> Pulse Sensor Amped <<
This code is for Pulse Sensor Amped by Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman
    www.pulsesensor.com 
    >>> Pulse Sensor purple wire goes to Analog Pin 0 <<<
Pulse Sensor sample aquisition and processing happens in the background via Timer 1 interrupt. 1mS sample rate.
PWM on pins 9 and 10 will not work when using this code!
The following variables are automatically updated:
Pulse :     boolean that is true when a heartbeat is sensed then false in time with pin13 LED going out.
Signal :    int that holds the analog signal data straight from the sensor. updated every 1mS.
HRV  :      int that holds the time between the last two beats. 1mS resolution.
BPM  :      int that holds the heart rate value. derived every pulse from averaging previous 10 HRV values.
QS  :       boolean that is made true whenever Pulse is found and BPM is updated. User must reset.

This code is designed with output serial data to Processing sketch "PulseSensorAmped_Processing-xx"
The Processing sketch is a simple data visualizer. 
All the work to find the heartbeat and determine the heartrate happens in the code below.
Pin 13 LED will blink with heartbeat.
It will also fade an LED on pin 11 with every beat. Put an LED and series resistor from pin 11 to GND

See the README for more information and known issues.
